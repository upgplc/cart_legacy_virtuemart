Copy the contents of the "securehosting" folder and the securehosting.xml file into the /tmp folder in your joomla root.

Log into the administrator side of joomla and click on "extensions" then click "Extension Manager".

Use the "Install from directory" method and type in the path to the /tmp folder. For example: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\joomla2-5-28\tmp. Click install.

This should install the UPG plugin and the secure hosting option should now appear in the "Payment Method" drop down when you create a new payment option in Joomla.

When setting up a new payment option in Joomla, click on the configuration tab and dont forget to enter the SH code and the check code for the customer.

This is all you need to do and the next time you run through the front end checkout system your new secure hosting payment option should be available.
